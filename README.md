# lessless
*Compiles all your project's LESS into CSS, converts LESS links into regular CSS links, and removes less.js from your html page.*

**CAUTION: This tool modifies your source code and therefore is meant to be run as part of a build process that creates a copy of your project files(like RequireJS and others).**

## Installing
`npm install lessless -g`

## Usage

### As Command Line Tool
`lessless /path/to/project`
OR
`cd /path/to/project`
`lessless`

### As Module
```js
var lessless = require('lessless');
lessless.optimizeProject('/path/to/project'); //OR process.cwd()
```

### Optionally specify @import paths
LESS needs to know where to look when it finds an @import in your less files. The defaults are the root of the project, and a CSS folder in the root. Lessless also automatically adds a less file's path when searching for imports, so that relative paths work without any extra configuration. You can add to these default places to look by passing an array of paths as the second parameter: 
```js
lessless.optimizeProject('/path/to/project', ['mystyles/less', 'look/here/for/styles/too']);
```

or from the command line (notice you have to use the --styledirs flag multiple times to pass multiple args)

```
lessless --styledirs /my/styles --styledirs /my/css
```

### Optionally specify extensions to strip (html is default).
```js
lessless.optimizeProject('/path/to/project', ['mystyles/less'], ['jsp', 'cshtml']);
```

or from the command line (notice you have to use the --strip flag multiple times to pass multiple args)

```
lessless --strip html --strip jsp
```

## So What Exactly Does It Do?
1. Scans your project for LESS files and generates the appropriate CSS files with the same names. For example if your project has a `styles/main.less`, a `styles/main.css` file will get created (using the [less.js](http://lesscss.org/#-server-side-usage) tool).
2. Updates any html files to reference the new CSS instead of the LESS.
For example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles/main.less" />
  </head>
</html>
```

becomes:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/main.css" />
  </head>
</html>
```
3. Removes the `less.js` file from your html because you don't need it once your LESS is compiled into regular CSS. Example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/less.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

becomes:

```html
<html>
  <head>

  </head>
</html>
```

## Run The Tests
`lessless` uses [busterjs](http://busterjs.org) for its tests. To run the tests you need to have buster installed: `npm install buster -g`.
 Then from the root of the lessless directory: `buster test`. Pull requests with tests are highly appreciated.
